# ChatterBox

## Project Overview
ChatterBox is a real-time chat application that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and detect entities in user messages. The application connects users via WebSocket, providing instant message delivery while leveraging an NLP service to enhance user interactions.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Socket.io
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **NLP Service**: Flask with SpaCy for entity detection

## Key Features
- Real-time messaging using WebSocket
- Entity detection in messages using NLP
- Scalable architecture with separate frontend and backend services

## What I've Learned
- Implementing real-time communication using Socket.io
- Building RESTful APIs with Express.js and Flask
- Integrating NLP capabilities into web applications using SpaCy
- Structuring a full-stack application with a clear separation of concerns

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend.
3. Start the Flask server on port 5000.
4. Start the Node.js server on port 4000.
5. Open the frontend application in your browser.
